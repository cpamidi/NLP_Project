Then we can write as follows : (P+Q)'s rate =(R-K)(candles/minute). Also ,we know from above data given about their rates; i..e., time required by p=(J/(p'srate))=((3*q)/r)=>time requested by q= ((j/k)*(q's rate)). So now putting these values into equation ; We get,(R + K )*(candle / min)+( J/ k * Candle/Min.)=> Time needed if two people work independently ==>Time spent on each one will be same so let say T ticks or seconds. Now according to question total number of candies left after finishing all food => Jar==>(T x C ). From first formula you got Total no of candies left after finished working individually ==>Total No Of candies before starting individual task == >(TxC)-(tX(R - K)), where X is multiplication sign ans C equal to whole amount of candie s.\", \"You are an mathematical assistant that helps users with the Algebra questions.

Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/√3\\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.\\n10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)\\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).\\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :\\nh = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)\\nh / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)\\nSo, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.\\nAnswer : A\", \"You are an mathematical assistant that helps users with the Algebra questions.

If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?\\nOptions: ['A)15', 'B)16', 'C)17', 'D)18', 'E)19']\\n\\n### Output\\nCorrect answer option: The correct answer option is Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.\\n=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.\\n=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)\\n=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x\\n=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x\\n=> y = 315 - (9/7)x\\n=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,\\nx = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153\\nx = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144\\nx = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135\\nx = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126\\nAs we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs. Thus total toys created by Jacob = y/9 = 135/9 = 15.\\nAnswer: A\", \"You are an mathematical assistant that helps users with the Algebra questions.

We need to purchase six sodas and seven bars. We know two sodas and three bars costs 300 cents, so to that purchase, we'd need to add four sodas and four bars - or four sets of items.

If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\\nOptions: ['A)20%', 'B)40%', 'C)50%', 'D)65%', 'E)75%']\\n\\n### Output\\nCorrect answer option: The correct answer option is Population now - 100;\\nPopulation one year from now - 110;\\nPopulation two years from now - 121;\\nSince the population two years from now (121) is exactly double the population one year ago then the population one year ago was 121/2=60.5.\\nNow, the question asks about the population increase over the last year, so from 60.5 (last year) to 100 (now): percent increase=difference/original*100=(100-60.5)/60.5*100=39.5/60.5*100=~2/3*100=~65%.\\nAnswer: D.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":34}],"source":["results"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"PNaymtXvKD61"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import datetime\n","\n","folder_path = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/685Project\"\n","timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S\")\n","file_name = f\"FineTuned_Llama2_test_eval_{timestamp}.csv\"\n","\n","results.to_csv(f'{folder_path}/{file_name}', index=False)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8m8JOtXqLZVD"},"source":["### Check overfitting model on small **set**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"s8bYVBOELW62"},"outputs":[],"source":["# test_results = trainer.evaluate(training_dataset)\n","# print(test_results)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ekOmTR1hSNcr"},"source":["<a name=\"Inference\"></a>\n","### Inference\n","Let's run the model!
