Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/√3\\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.\\n10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)\\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).\\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :\\nh = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)\\nh / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3).

If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?\\nOptions: ['A)15', 'B)16', 'C)17', 'D)18', 'E)19']\\n\\n### Output\\nRationale:Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.\\n=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.\\n=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)\\n=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x\\n=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x\\n=> y = 315 - (9/7)x\\n=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,\\nx = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153\\nx = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144\\nx = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135\\nx = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126\\nAs we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs. Thus total toys created by Jacob = y/9 = 135/9 = 15.\\nAnswer: A\\nCorrect answer:A</s>\", \"You are an mathematical assistant that helps users with the Algebra questions.

(B) doesn’t have to be true – consider what would happen if x = -2 and y = 1. (C) can never be true, as x^3 must be negative, and y^2 must be positive. (D) can never be true, since if x < 0, -x is the same thing as |x|, and |x| > y. (E) can be manipulated by multiplying both sides by -1, which gives us –x > y. Remember that x < 0, so –x = |x|, and y is positive, so |y| = y. Thus –x^3 > y^2 is the same statement as |x^3| > |y^2|, and (B) must be true.\\nCorrect answer:B</s>\", \"You are an mathematical assistant that helps users with the Algebra questions.

Let a = kp, where both k and p are positive integers.\\nThus, Q = (kp)4=k4∗p4(kp)4=k4∗p4. Now the number of factors of Q = (4+1)*(4+1) = 25. But as the given condition states that Q has ONLY 5 factors, thus \"a\" can\\'t have any other factor except 1 and itself. Thus, a = prime number.\\nStatement I :We can represent Q = (a^2)^2. Thus, we have to prove whether a^2 is a prime number. Take a=2. We can see that it is not a prime number. Thus, this option can\\'t answer a \"MUST be true question\"\\nStatement II : Always true as proved above.\\nStatement III : Again take a =2. Thus, Q = 64.

We need to purchase six sodas and seven bars. We know two sodas and three bars costs 300 cents, so to that purchase, we'd need to add four sodas and four bars - or four sets of items.
